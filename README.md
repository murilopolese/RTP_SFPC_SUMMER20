> In Recreating the Past, we will study computational art from the past decades and recreate these works with contemporary techniques to gain aesthetic, analytical and technical knowledge.

Check the original [repository](https://github.com/ofZach/RTP_SFPC_SUMMER20) for the class examples and [course page](https://sfpc.io/recreatingthepast-spring2020/) for more details.
